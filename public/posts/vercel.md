My Love/Hate Relationship With Vercel

As a developer, finding the perfect platform to deploy your projects is like finding the right tool for a complex task—it can make or break your workflow. When I first discovered Vercel, it felt like a breath of fresh air.

# The Beauty of Vercel's User Experience

## A Seamless Workflow

Vercel is designed with developers in mind, and it shows. From the moment you sign up, the platform guides you through the deployment process with an ease that's almost addictive. Whether you're deploying a static site, a serverless function, or a complex [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, Vercel has streamlined the experience so that even a novice can get their project live with minimal friction.

One of the standout features is the automatic deployment from GitHub. Just push your changes to the main branch, and Vercel handles the rest. There's no need for manual configuration or tedious setups—Vercel's smart enough to recognize your project's framework and adjust accordingly. This level of automation is a *game-changer* for productivity, allowing me to focus more on writing code and less on managing deployments. The dashboard is another area where Vercel shines. It's clean, intuitive, and provides all the necessary information at a glance.

## Developer Focused Features

I can monitor my deployments, `view logs`, and manage environments without jumping through hoops. The thoughtful design makes it a pleasure to use, turning what could be a stressful part of development into something I _actually_ look forward to.

```typescript
const summaryRanges = (nums: number[]) => {
  let ranges: string[] = [];
  let start = 0;

  if (nums.length === 0) return [];

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1] + 1) {
      if (i <= start + 1) ranges.push(nums[start].toString());
      else ranges.push(`${nums[start]}->${nums[i - 1]}`);
      start = i;
    }
  }

  if (start === nums.length - 1) ranges.push(nums[start].toString());
  else ranges.push(`${nums[start]}->${nums[nums.length - 1]}`);

  return ranges;
};
```

# The Frustration of Vercel's Pricing

However, this love affair hits a snag when it comes to Vercel's pricing. For small projects or personal use, the free tier is generous. But as soon as your needs scale even slightly, the costs can escalate quickly. The leap from the free tier to the Pro plan feels steep, and for many developers, it might be hard to justify the expense, especially for side projects or smaller clients.

The pricing model is based on bandwidth and build execution, which can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great that you're only paying for what you use. On the other hand, it can be difficult to predict how much you'll end up spending, especially if your project experiences sudden traffic spikes or requires frequent builds. The lack of a more granular or customizable pricing option can make it challenging to manage costs effectively.

What's particularly frustrating is that many of the features that make Vercel so appealing, such as advanced analytics or enhanced build performance, are locked behind the higher pricing tiers. It feels like you're being teased with all these fantastic tools, only to realize that accessing them will cost you significantly more.

# The Love/Hate Balance

So where does that leave me? Vercel is still my go-to platform for many projects because, quite simply, it works beautifully. The user experience is unparalleled, and the time it saves me is invaluable. But every time I hit a pricing wall, I'm reminded that this relationship isn't perfect.
In the end, my love/hate relationship with Vercel is a balancing act. I adore the ease of use, the thoughtful design, and the power it gives me as a developer. Yet, I can't ignore the frustration that comes with the pricing model. It's a platform that's almost perfect—almost. ♥️
